# Readme

This is a small viewer for ical streams written in PHP. All .ics files in the *./calendar* subdirectory will be parsed and displayed in a calendar. In a sidebar, you will get an overview of your calendars (say, all the ics files by their file names) and a list of upcoming events. 

## What does it not support?

> Timezones

> Adding events (*This is only a calendar viewer, not a full calendar editor*)
